# Galaxy-Conqueror

In "Galaxy Conqueror," each player starts with a single planet that generates resources over time. The goal is to manage your resources, upgrade your planet's defenses, or build forces to attack other players' planets. You can mine resources with workers, which you then use to strengthen your planet or create ships and weapons for attacking other players. Players can challenge each other in turn-based battles, and the winner takes over the defeated player's planet. The game focuses on simple resource management, upgrades, and battles with the aim of becoming the most powerful player in the galaxy. Key Features: Resource Generation: Your planet automatically generates resources. Upgrades: Use resources to upgrade your defenses or create offensive forces. Attack and Conquer: Battle other players and take over their planets. Multiplayer: Compete with others to conquer planets and expand your empire.
